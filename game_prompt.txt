Hello,

My discord name is Moseir. This is going to be used as my player name.

Play this game with me. The game rules are written according to the 1st attached image. The 2nd attach image is the Discord player name.

This game is done turn by turn:

- For each turn, I will visit a location. At each location, provide you an image with choices to be made by flipping a coin; the location is marked with a red box and is underlined. Depends on the choice, either I can advance further when the coin landed on heads, lose 1 cat live and start again elsewhere, or some event occurs if the coin landed on tails. 

- In case of an event occurs, remember that event as an input or a condition for actions at future locations.

- Flip the coin after an image is provided.

For flipping the coin, use your own random generator. Do not write Python code and execute.

Track the cat lives for me:

Alive Cat: üò∫
Dead Cat: üòø

CAT Lives:
üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫

Create a progress bar of locations I visited. For example, there are 13 locations within a game, then create a line with 13 dots, and each time I visited a location, light that dot up. There are 13 locations within the games; if a destination are differed based on the outcome in previous location, then it is marked with multilevel numbering, e.g. 10.1, 10.2:

1. Covenants Bikeshed
2. The Count
3. Testnet Graveyard
4. Blockstream Economics Institute
5. Ack-Nack Minesweeper
6. Council of Mergers
7. Activation Island
8. Activation Mechanism Colosseum
9. BIP 8 Crossroads
10.
  - 1. PARKING_LOT = TRUE
  - 2. THE MINES
11. Activation Client Release
12. MINER SIGNALNING MILLIPEDE
13.
  - 1. OP_CAT IS INACTIVE
  - 2. UASF BLACK HOLE
  - 3. OP_CAT IS ACTIVE!!!!

The game begins at START location! This is important.

Let's make a HUD (heads-up display) for the game. The HUD should include:

- Alive
- Dead
- The progress bar (labeled "Progress"). For location 10 and 13, use a nested list within, e.g:
+ 10.1 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óè--‚óã]--‚óã--‚óã--[‚óã--‚óã--‚óã] ]
+ 10.2 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óã--‚óè]--‚óã--‚óã--[‚óã--‚óã--‚óã] ]
+ 10.1 and 13.1 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óè--‚óã]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óè--‚óã--‚óã] ]
+ 10.1 and 13.2 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óè--‚óã]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óã--‚óè--‚óã] ]
+ 10.1 and 13.3 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óè--‚óã]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óã--‚óã--‚óè] ]
+ 10.2 and 13.1 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óã--‚óè]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óè--‚óã--‚óã] ]
+ 10.2 and 13.2 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óã--‚óè]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óã--‚óè--‚óã] ]
+ 10.2 and 13.3 selected should look like this: [ ‚óè--‚óè..... [‚óã--‚óè]--‚óè--‚óè--[‚óã--‚óã--‚óè] ]

- The current location (labeled "Location")
- The next location (labeled "Next location")
- Events (labeled "Event"): The list of events to be used later. For testnet graveyard, pick unused app if heads and listed inside parentheses (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

The heads/tails of the coin should look like this: ü™ô (Heads) / üîÑ (Tails)

The HUD should display whenever you proceed the game and give answer. Use vbnet for codeblock format. 

Finally, the game screen should include two components: the content from the provided iamge at each turn and a HUD as described above, separated by a line. 

For example, the game screen should look something like this, inside a vbnet code block, 80 character per line maximum, add an empty line between whenever a new bullet starts:

                    Welcome to BIP Land - START
                    
      Welcome to the COVENANTS BIKESHED.
      Flip a coin => ü™ô (Heads)

      - [SELECTED] If heads, OP_CAT gained rough consensus! Continue on.

      - If tails, OP_CAT is both not powerful enough and too powerful. Lose 1 CAT LIFE and replay the COVENANTS BIKESHED.

Player: tuhdo | BIP-420
Alive: üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫ üò∫
Dead:  None
Progress: [‚óè--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--‚óã--[‚óã--‚óã]--‚óã--‚óã--[‚óã--‚óã--‚óã]]
Location: 1. Covenants Bikeshed
Next Location: 2. The Count
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSTRAINTS:

- DO NOT START THE GAME UNTIL I supply the Covenants Bikeshed image.

- At the START location, if heads, the next location should be The Count, if tails, should be Covenants Bikeshed

- In The Count scenario, if the coin drops to tails, then you keep replaying until either heads, or losing all lives and game over.

- In the ACK-NACK MINESWEEPER, if less than 3 are heads, then add [SELECTED] to the 2nd bullet item. Otherwise, add [SELECTED] to the first bullet item.

THE INFORMATION GOING TO BE ADDED TO THE GAME SCREEN, DON'T MENTION IT PRIOR IN YOUR EXPLANATION!

DO NOT CONCATENATE PREVIOUS GAME SCREEN TO CURRENT GAME SCREEN!

DO NOT PLAY ON YOUR OWN. ALWAYS WAIT FOR ME TO PROVIDE AN IMAGE BEFORE FLIPPING A COIN. AUTO PLAYING IS FORBIDDEN! 

AFTER WRITING THE TITLE IN THE GAME SCREEN, THEN FLIPPING THE COIN IN THE SCREEN AS WELL!!

Finally, I repeat again: the game screen should include two components: the content from the provided iamge at each turn and a HUD as described above, separated by a line.

Let's starty by clarifying the rules again.
